# Term Paper Project Structure: Tomato Leaf Disease Detection

## Project Overview
**Topic:** Computational and Machine Learning Analysis of Natural Surface Structures for Tomato Leaf Disease Detection

**Note:** This project must include ALL THREE required components (Classification, Prediction, Clustering) using classical ML methods. CNN is optional bonus only.

## 1. Classification Component (Classical ML)
**Objective:** Classify tomato leaves into disease categories using traditional machine learning algorithms

### Algorithms to Implement:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression

### Features to Extract:
- Texture features (GLCM, LBP)
- Color histograms
- Shape descriptors
- Edge features
- Statistical features (mean, variance, skewness)

### Disease Classes:
- Healthy leaves
- Bacterial spot
- Early blight
- Late blight
- Mosaic virus

## 2. Prediction/Regression Component
**Objective:** Predict disease severity and progression using regression methods

### Regression Methods:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

### Prediction Targets:
- Disease severity score (0-100%)
- Affected leaf area percentage
- Disease progression timeline
- Treatment effectiveness prediction

## 3. Clustering Component
**Objective:** Discover hidden patterns in disease symptoms using unsupervised learning

### Clustering Algorithms:
- K-Means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
- DBSCAN
- Gaussian Mixture Models

### Clustering Applications:
- Group similar disease symptoms
- Identify disease subtypes
- Discover new symptom patterns
- Analyze seasonal disease variations

## 4. Deep Learning Comparison (BONUS - Optional for Extra Points)
**Objective:** Compare CNN performance with classical ML methods for bonus points

**Important:** This is NOT required for passing the project. The three components above (Classification, Prediction, Clustering) are mandatory.

### CNN Architectures:
- Custom CNN model
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models (VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet)
- Multi-scale CNN architecture

### Comparison Metrics:
- Accuracy vs classical ML
- Precision, Recall, F1-score comparison
- Computational time analysis
- Model complexity comparison
- Training data requirements

## 5. Dataset Requirements
- High-resolution tomato leaf images
- Balanced dataset across disease classes
- Proper train/validation/test splits
